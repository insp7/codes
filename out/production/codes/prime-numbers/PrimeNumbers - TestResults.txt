TESTS: 

The input numbers given to prime-checker function were all odd numbers starting from 3(i.e. 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ... ,181935769); Because all even numbers are composite, hence avoid that computation. 

1) Using traditional approach: 
CODE SNIPPET OF SIMPLE PRIME-CHECKER FUNCTION: 
/**
 * Function to check if the given number is prime.
 * 
 * @param  number Specifies the passed number
 * @return        returns true if the given number is prime, else returns false.
 */
private static boolean isPrime(long number) {
	if(number == 2) return true; // Smallest prime number.
	if(number % 2 == 0) return false; // check if its an even number; if true, return false; since all even numbers are composite.

	long iterations = 0;
	for(long i = 3L; i <= number; i += 2) {
		iterations++;
		if(number % i == 0) {
			System.out.println("iterations = "+iterations);
			return false;
		}
	}
	System.out.println("Iterations = "+iterations);
	return true; 
}

--  Time required to calculate Prime numbers between 1 to 1 Million = 3:13.64 mins(equivalent to 193.64 seconds).

THE ABOVE TIME CAN BE FURTHER IMPROVED, BY DOING THE FOLLOWING CHANGES IN THE 'for' LOOP:
	for(long i = 3L; i <= number/2; i += 2) { // notice that now 'i' will do only 'number/4' iterations (whereas, previously it was performing 'number/2' iterations)
		.
		.
		.
	}

--  Time required to calculate Prime numbers between 1 to 1 Million by using the above for-loop = 1:37.94 mins(equivalent to 97.94 seconds).
	This works better due to the addition of 'number/2', since , now 'i' has to iterate only till 'number/2'; 
	AND also, in every iteration 'i' is getting incremented by 2 i.e. i =+ 2, so the number of iterations is reduced to 'number/4' iterations.

	However, there is a significantly better approach for checking primality of a number, namely 'Trial Division' algorithm/approach.

2) Using Trial Division Algorithm: 
CODE SNIPPET OF TRIAL_DIVISION PRIME-CHECKER FUNCTION: 
/**
 * Function to check if the given number is prime using Trial Division algorithm;
 * If any prime number whose square does not exceed 'number' divides it without a remainder, then 'number' is not prime.
 * 
 * @param  number Specifies the passed number
 * @return        returns true if the given number is prime, else returns false.
 */
private static boolean isPrimeUsingTrialDivision(long number) {
	if(number == 2) return true; // Smallest prime number.
	if(number % 2 == 0) return false; // check if its an even number; if true, return false; since all even numbers are composite.

	long iterations = 0L;
	for(long i = 3L; (i * i) <= number; i += 2) { // NOTICE the number of iterations will be significantly reduced.
		iterations++;	
		if(number % i == 0) {
			System.out.println("Iterations = "+iterations);
			return false;
		}
	}
	System.out.println("Iterations = "+iterations);
	return true; 
}

--  Time required to calculate first 10.131906 Million Prime numbers was a LITTLE LESS THAN 2:03:16.30(2hours-3mins-16seconds-30milliseconds).
	Hence, consider 2:03:16.30 as an approximate time required to calculate first 10.131906 Million prime numbers.
	Performing such a large oepration using the traditional approach is very inconvenient.

--  Time required to calculate Prime numbers between 1 to 1 Million = 22.75 seconds.
	(This is significantly better than the previous approaches which estimated to 193.64 and 97.94 seconds resp.)
	
--  Time required to check if the number '1000000005721' is prime or not: 0.43 seconds. (It is a prime number)
	Looping iterations required to check if the number '1000000005721' is prime or not = 499999.
	
	NOTE: 
	If normal approach is used for checking if the number '1000000005721' is prime or not, 
	the amount of time required and iterations performed would be significantly larger;

	Consider the normal approach of doing 'number/2' iterations:
	our number = 1000000005721; so number/2 = 1000000005721/2 = 500000002861 iterations which is possible; 
	HOWEVER, very impractical and inconvenient due to the time required for such a calculation, because:
		We know, Approximate time required for performing 499999 iterations = 0.43 seconds;
		therefore, time required for performing 1 million iterations = 0.43 * 2 = 0.86 seconds; approximate it to 1 second.
		so, lets say, Approximate time required for performing 1 million iterations = 1 second.
		
		now, we need to perform 500000002861 iterations.
		Therefore, time required for performing 500000002861 iterations = (500000002861 / iterations performed in 1 second)
																		= (500000002861 / 1 million iterations)
																		= 500000.002861 seconds.
																		= 500000 seconds. (considering Approximate value)

		NOW, 500000 seconds = 5.7870370 Days = 138.88 Hours.
		SPENDING 138.88 Hours/ 5.7870370 Days IS VERY IMPRACTICAL AND INEFFICIENT! 

	Even with the approach of performing 'number/4' iterations:
		1000000005721/4 = 250000001430 iterations;
		250000001430 / 1 million = 250000.00143 = 250000 seconds. (Considering Approximating value)
		250000 seconds = 2.8935185 Days = 69.44 Hours.
		AGAIN, WAITING FOR 2.8935185 Days or 69.44 Hours IS VERY INEFFICIENT APPROACH. 

FACT: Total Prime numbers bet. 1 to 1 million = 78498.
